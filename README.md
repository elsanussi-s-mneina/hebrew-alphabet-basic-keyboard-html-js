# hebrew-alphabet-basic-keyboard-html-js
Type the letters of the Hebrew alphabet in your browser without installing a keyboard layout.

You can use it now at https://elsanussi-s-mneina.github.io/hebrew-alphabet-basic-keyboard-html-js/

## What is the purpose
I wanted to make a simpler way to type text in a language. This way includes the fewest buttons and the most straightforward way to type text.

## Constraints in the design
- Have the least number of buttons on the screen, with only one function per button

## Constraints on the implementation
- Use HTML and Javascript, and no third party libraries 
- Ensure the whole web application can be downloaded as a single file
